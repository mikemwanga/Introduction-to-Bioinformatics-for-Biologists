# Introduction-to-Bioinformatics-for-Biologists

## Course Overview
This short course aims to provide an introduction to the field of bioinformatics, targeting research students with basic knowledge in this field. The course will be delivered using a combination of theoretical and practical sessions for participants to gain hands-on experience in using various bioinformatics tools and methods. This will support the ongoing initiatives in building capacity in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and developing future leaders in research.

## Expected learning outcomes
After this course, participants should be able to;
Have an overview of the most important bioinformatics methods and tools 
Comfortably use main bioinformatics databases such as NCBI
Manipulate files and perform analysis using Linux 
Collaborate and document research work on GitHub
Use selective tools to run bioinformatics analysis
Understand sequencing technologies and perform basic sequence analysis using existing tools

## Date of Course
25 – 29 July 2022, 9 am – 5 pm

## Course Venue
Pwani University Bioscience Research Center (PUBReC Boardroom)

## Mode of Delivery
Virtual (Zoom/KENET, slack) and one-on-one practicals

## Intended Audience
This course is intended for Pwani University students (already identified 10 students) who are currently (or in the future) undertaking research in biological sciences and will generate data whose analysis requires bioinformatics tools and skills. A baseline understanding of the central dogma is recommended. 

## Participating institutions
Pwani University

## Outcome
Students will be equipped with basic skills in bioinformatics. This will form the basic foundation needed to grow their knowledge in NGS data analysis. 
A certificate of participation and facilitation will be offered.

## Requirements
Participants are expected to have access to the internet and a personal computer, preferably running on Linux. Required tools and software will be communicated prior to the training.
